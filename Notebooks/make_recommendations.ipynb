A lot of recommendations by sim_1 are a little offbeat and help us in keeping the recommendations fresh and the users interest intact. The decision of taking the weights as 1 and 0.3 have come from experimentation and by looking at the values of sim_1 and sim_cat(sim_1 has the largest value of 520 whereas sim_cat has 5). \n",
