About Internship:
														Why Internship?Landing a job in this tough economy is no easy feat—especially for college students and recent grads. They often spend weeks scouring online job boards, polishing cover letters and blasting out résumés to no avail.Not only can job-seeking students and college graduates land full-time jobs through internships—but they also get a chance to test-drive a career before committing. “Meanwhile, employers get the opportunity to find the talent they need to help grow their business without relying on just a short interview,” Lander says. “Entry level employees are the future of a company and so in many ways the most important recruiting decisions an employer can make.”“The most important factor employers look at when deciding who to hire is interview performance because they want to make sure that the student will be a good fit for their organization,” Lander says.Experience is important and it necessarily means they need to have previous internship or work experience, he says. “The employer will look at what the student has been learning at school, relevant projects, course work and extracurricular activities. In a highly competitive job environment employers want to see that a candidate has the hunger to be successful more than purely in an academic setting.”What do we expect from an Intern?As an Intern we expect you to have?

														students and recent grads. They often spend weeks scouring online job boards, polishing cover letters and blasting out résumés to no avail.Not only can job-seeking students and college graduates land full-time jobs through internships—but they also get a chance to test-drive a career before committing. “Meanwhile, employers get the opportunity to find the talent they need to help grow their business without relying on just a short interview,” Lander says. “Entry level employees are the future of a company and so in many ways the most important recruiting decisions an employer can make.”“The most important factor employers look at when deciding who to hire is interview performance because they want to make sure that the student will be a good fit for their organization,” Lander says.Experience is important and it necessarily means they need to have previous internship or work experience, he says. “The employer will look at what the student has been learning at school, relevant projects, course work and extracurricular activities. In a highly competitive job environment employers want to see that a candidate has the hunger to be successful more than purely in an academic setting.”
														
Roles and Responsibilities:
														* The candidate will have to undergo training in the technology that would be used in developing the software.* The candidate will have to play a active role in designing and analysing the project before he actually start developing the project.* The candidate will be involved in all the stages of the project (Analysing, Designing, Developing / Coding, Testing and Documentation.)
